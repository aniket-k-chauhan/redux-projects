# redux-projects
This repo includes projects that I have created while learning about Redux. 
Below is the list of Projects:

1. [Redux Blog](https://github.com/aniket-k-chauhan/redux-projects/tree/redux-blog):
   - This is the basic blogging website on which I have used Redux as a state management tool.
   - The Redux Blog contains CRUD operations on posts.

2. [Redux Blog using RTK Query](https://github.com/aniket-k-chauhan/redux-projects/tree/redux-blog-using-rtk-query):
   - In this, I have used Redux RTK Query, which will optimise the performance of Redux Blog by only rendering those components that need to be re-render.

3. [Todo List using RTK Query](https://github.com/aniket-k-chauhan/redux-projects/tree/todo-using-rtk-query):
   - Create a Todo List web app using Redux RTK Query.
   - In this project, I am performing CRUD operations using the RTK Query `createApi` API for query and mutation.
